## About.
This repo is inspired by listening to Brian Johnson's 7 Minute Security Podcast. On that show, there is a series of episodes called 'Tales of an Internal Pentest Pwnage'. After listening to a few episodes, I realised that I have direct access to a Pentest Playbook, told beautifully as a story, from one episode to the next.

I decided to keep notes and this repo represents my very rough notes from listening to those episdes.

I personally use Obsidian to make this notes and my personal opinion is that these notes look better on Obsidian.
