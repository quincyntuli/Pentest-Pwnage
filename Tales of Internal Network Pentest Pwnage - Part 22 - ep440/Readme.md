# 2 Day Pentest

> - Tool called [Pcredz](https://github.com/lgandx/PCredz), which tells you if it has captured any information in the clear
> - Ran `Responder -rPv`  to catch hashes sent by browser without causing pop ups, for a few minutes and killed it, captured hashes
> - Ran hashes through pwned passwords lists. Delivery meetings are not alarmed/impressed by the ability to crack the hashes. That is expected as they would tell you about the dropping costs of hash rigs, anyone could do it. They are alarmed when those hashes exist on password dumps on the internet.
> - Fed the users through Impacket's GetUserSPN for kerberoastable acocunts. Got those hashes and cracked the hashes. Several of those were DA admin. The issue was those hashes were on Pwnpassword lists.
> - Fed the passwords through CME on subnets in scope and got confirmation of those creds.


## Something New

> - In some organizations, local admin passwords on ordinary workstations are  sometimes passwords to Domain Controller Admins. In other words, while you may not know usernames that are Domain Admins, those users may be using the same passwords for their Domain Controller 'Admnistrator' user passwords.
> - Use Netwrix to `Detect Who Added a User to Domain Admins Group`
